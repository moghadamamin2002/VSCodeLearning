# step1 => Traverse the infix expression and check if given character is an operator or an operand.



# step2 => If it is an operand, then push it into operand stack.



# step3 => If it is an operator, then check if priority of current operator is greater than or less than or equal to the operator at top of the stack.
# If priority is greater, then push operator into operator stack. 
# Otherwise pop two operands from operand stack, pop operator from operator stack and push string operator + operand 2 + operand 1 into operand stack.
# Keep popping from both stacks and pushing result into operand stack until priority of current operator is less than or equal to operator at top of the operator stack.



# step4 => If current character is â€˜(â€˜, then push it into operator stack.



# step5 => If current character is â€˜)â€™, then check if top of operator stack is opening bracket or not.
# If not pop two operands from operand stack, pop operator from operator stack and push string operator + operand 2 + operand 1 into operand stack.
# Keep popping from both stacks and pushing result into operand stack until top of operator stack is an opening bracket.



# step6 =>The final prefix expression is present at top of operand stack.
